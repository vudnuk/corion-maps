- mockup for main coal town map with some janky collision that doesn't work. you can teleport to the mine if you walk directly left of the player spawn point (altho player does not go with you lol)
- the player moves tho which is nice (just don't do diagonal)
- missing: house interiors, proper coal town mine, coal town coke works, coal town pit heap

i'll have a crack at navigation/level transitions if you haven't got something already for it
